## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**If upload fails:**
1. Check file size limits (GitHub: 2GB max per file) ✅ We're under 25MB
2. Try uploading one file at a time
3. Check internet connection
4. Verify you have write access to repository

**If tag is wrong:**
```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d v2.0.5

# Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v2.0.5

# Recreate tag
git tag -a v2.0.5 -m "Release message"
git push origin v2.0.5
```
